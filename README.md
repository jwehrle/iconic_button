# iconic_button

An alternative to Flutter ToggleButtons which supports individual button usage without knowing the size of the button 
and which is focused on icons with optional labels. Additionally, this package exposes a controller to programmatically
enable, disable, select or unselect buttons without calling setState().

This button uses ButtonStyle, MaterialStates, and InkWell to follow Material Design guidelines and is based loosely on
the official ElevatedButton in the Flutter platform itself.

What this button offers:

1 Optionally captioned icons. Icons are great but on their own can be mystifying.

2 Selection and disabling methods which alter the appearance and function of the button based on Material Design
guidelines.

3 Resetable properties: Icon, label, and style can be changed in reaction to your own custom events.

This package was built to serve needs I have found in other projects of mine. I am making it available publicly as I
have benefited from the hard work of others.



## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart

a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
