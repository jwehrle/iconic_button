# iconic_button

A general Material Design style button that requires an icon but has an optional label which is displayed beneath the
icon.

This button uses ButtonStyle, MaterialStates, and InkWell to follow Material Design guidelines and is based loosely on
the official ElevatedButton in the Flutter platform itself.

What this button offers:

1 Optionally captioned icons. Icons are great but on their own can be mystifying.

2 Selection and disabling methods which alter the appearance and function of the button based on Material Design
guidelines.

3 Resetable properties: Icon, label, and style can be changed in reaction to your own custom events.

This package was built to serve needs I have found in other projects of mine. I am making it available as I have benefited the hard work of others.

multiple Flutter or Dart projects.
